Coolness is an aesthetic of attitude, behavior, comportment, appearance and style which is generally admired. 
Because of the varied and changing connotations of cool, as well as its subjective nature, the word has no single meaning. 

Cool is also an attitude widely adopted by artists and intellectuals, who thereby aided its infiltration into popular culture. Sought by product marketing firms, idealized by teenagers, a shield against racial oppression or political persecution and source of constant cultural innovation, cool has become a global phenomenon that has spread to every corner of the earth.[7] Concepts of cool have existed for centuries in several cultures.[8]

Although commonly regarded as slang, it is widely used among disparate social groups and has endured in usage for generations.
